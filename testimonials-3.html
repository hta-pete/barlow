            <h3 class="heading--4">Would you tell us a little about yourself?</h3>
            <p>Well, I'm from Greenville, Mississippi. I grew up there. I played football at Milsaps College. I worked at Milsaps college for three years. I was in the administration at Holmes Community College for 22 years. I became Orthodox in 1987 and got most of my formal seminary education at St. Tikhons in South Canaan, Pennsylvania. I'm the senior pastor here at Saint Peter Orthodox Church in Madison.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="testimonial-question">
            <h3 class="heading--4">How did your relationship with Joe Barlow start?</h3>
            <p>Our church was growing, and we needed more space and we needed it to be most newly appointed anyway as an Orthodox church would be. We just made a bid like everybody else did. And I guess that's how I met him. I had a chair of the committee and some very dedicated people that did a fantastic job working with me to plan the first and second building renovations that we made.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="testimonial-question">
            <h3 class="heading--4">What was it like working with Joe?</h3>
            <p>There was a synergy between us. I think contractors get off when they start assuming things, making decisions for their clients and not consulting their clients. I don't remember that happening with us at all. Joe and his people listened. And we went forward together. He didn't get up in front of us. I appreciated that.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="testimonial-question">
            <h3 class="heading--4">When you hear that “Building Better Together” is the Barlow motto, does that ring true to you?</h3>
            <p>Yeah. I think that's a nice summation. And I'd go so far as to say that it represents what our experience was in both projects we worked together on.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="testimonial-question">
            <h3 class="heading--4">Would you recommend Barlow to others looking for the services he provides?</h3>
            <p>Well, I have recommended him before, so it's not a hypothetical question for me. I wouldn't have any hesitancy in recommending him. I would say that we found Joe and those who work for him to be honest, and to provide good quality work and to stand by their work. And to be easy to work with.</p>
