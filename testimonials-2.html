            <p><strong>Patty:</strong> We’ve known Joe for many years. We went to church together for a long time...</p>
              <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> ...he's done some minor construction work and stuff at the church, that’s how I got to know him. I've had him come look at buildings for me to get his advice. We called him when we found out the house, the one we are living in now, was for sale. We called him and wanted him to come and take a look at it before we purchased it because it was an older house, built in 1972.</p>
              <p><strong>Patty:</strong> We knew that if we kept it, we would want to remodel it, but we didn't know if it was worth keeping.</p>
              <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Joe came and looked at it and he crawled all through the crawl spaces in the house and everywhere and he said this house's construction is of commercial grade quality. He said the bones are definitely worth saving.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="testimonial-question">
            <h3 class="heading--4">Did you feel that Joe understood your needs and shared your concerns?</h3>
            <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I've built several things and I know the business. Joe would point out things that I’d have overlooked. I'm just looking at it for the cosmetic or a financial point-of-view. Joe helped us make some tough decisions and walked us through everything.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="testimonial-question">
            <h3 class="heading--4">What would you say about Joe’s work ethic, his way of working?</h3>
            <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Joe is meticulous. He is a...</p>
            <p><strong>Patty:</strong> Perfectionist.</p>
            <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yes, Perfectionist. And he would come in and he would see something, and say, we need to do something about that. And I'd look at it and say well, it looks good to me, but he would say, I think we need to fix that. And he would and it turned out great. I mean, everybody that comes to our house is wowed and just amazed.</p>
            <p><strong>Patty:</strong> And I can't tell you how many times I came in and Cole was up on a scaffold, or up in the attic, or sawing something. I mean, he was like one of the workers as well, as a supervisor.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="testimonial-question">
            <h3 class="heading--4">Joe acts as the single point-of-contact, did you find any advantage in that?</h3>
            <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Oh yeah, definitely.</p>
            <p><strong>Patty:</strong> He was over here every day...</p>
            <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> ...all day sometimes. It was nice just to have one or two people to go to instead of a big conglomerate. Joe was here just about every day. And if he wasn't here, he was close by. Cole was close by. We would call and they would be here within the hour.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="testimonial-question">
            <h3 class="heading--4">Does the slogan, “Building Better Together” ring true to you?</h3>
            <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Oh, definitely. I mean it was a joint effort for all the above. Joe saw things and made them right. He was looking out for us, at that point, a year and a half, two years down the road. We're in our house, and we love it and we don't have any complaints. We don’t have to call him back and say this or that isn't right. He was looking into the future.</p>
